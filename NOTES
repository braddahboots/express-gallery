NOTES
 - Details.Jade
  - Hero Image
    - Able to populate image and columns along with header
    - Working towards refactoring code on server.js to push the object of the image we are calling on and assigning that object to a new key. (remove it from the array being passed into the argument).
    - Goal for this is to seperate image clicked on to the space reserved for the hero image.
  - Columns
    - Once hero image is removed from array we need to populate at random only 3 indexes. This will be random on every details page.
- Things left to do
  - Routes
  - Add images
  - Edit images
  - Delete images
